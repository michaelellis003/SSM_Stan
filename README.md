# dlmstan
1. dlmFilter.stan function for numerically stable SVD based Kalman filter for univariate and multivaraite time-invariant DLM.
2. dlmSmooth.stan function for numerically stable SVD based smoother for univariate and multivaraite time-invariant DLM.  
3. stan_dlm.stan estimates unknown observation and state variance-covariance matrices for univariate and multivaraite time-invariant DLMs using the Kalman filter to define the loglikelihood of the unknown parameters.
